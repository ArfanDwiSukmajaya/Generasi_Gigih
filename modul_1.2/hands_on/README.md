Lets assume that we have a Song shema with this format
{ title: “song title”, artists: [{ name: “artist name 1”}], duration: 200 }

Create a function that

1. Accept a promise of Song list
2. Print an error message if the promise rejected.
3. Print all songs list if the promise is fulfilled
   In 2 version (Promise and async/await)
